I had not intended to write my memoirs and did not keep a diary. To do so would have inhibited my
work.
Five years after I stepped down as prime minister, my old friend and colleague, Lim Kim San,
chairman of Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), convinced me that the young would read my memoirs
since they were interested in a book of my old speeches that SPH had published in Chinese. I was
also troubled by the apparent over-confidence of a generation that has only known stability, growth

nationalistic new states in Southeast Asia. They take it as quite normal that in less than 40 years the
World Bank has reclassified Singapore from a less developed to a developed country.
To write this book I had to revive memories of events long forgotten, reading through minutes of
meetings, letters written and received, and oral history transcripts of colleagues. It was psychological
stocktaking, and I was surprised how disturbing it was occasionally although these events were past
and over with.
I had one powerful critic and helper, my wife, Choo. She went over every word that I wrote, many
times. We had endless arguments. She is a conveyancing lawyer by profession. I was not drafting a
will or a conveyance to be scrutinised by a judge. Nevertheless she demanded precise, clear and
unambiguous language. Choo was a tower of strength, giving me constant emotional and intellectual
