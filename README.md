# Lee Kuan Yew AI Clone - Cursor Hackathon 25

This project is a submission for the Cursor Hackathon 25.

## The Vision

We have cloned the wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew into an AI. This allows you to interact with a digital version of one of history's most influential leaders.

## What you can do:

*   **Ask him anything:** Get his perspective on politics, economics, and life.
*   **Talk to him:** Have a conversation about your life and get his advice.
*   **Gain wisdom:** Learn from his vast experience and unique insights.

This is more than just a chatbot. It's an opportunity to engage with a great mind.
